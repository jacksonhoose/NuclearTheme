# Nuclear Theme
## Requires PHP 5.4 or greater

This is my opinionated Wordpress boilerplate that I personally use on all my production websites.  There are some things that I will be changing/adding as I see fit.

## Features:
* Normalize.css
* SCSS Support/Directory structure
* Javascript minification/concatonation/linting
* Image optimization
* Gulp Task runner
* Bower asset management
* Utilities Classes
* Better Javascript Structure
* Nuclear 'micro' Api -> a simple way to run WP_Queries from the front end

## How to use the Gulp task runner
* CD into theme directory
* Install Node.js & bundler
* run `npm install`
* run `bundle install`
* run `gulp`
