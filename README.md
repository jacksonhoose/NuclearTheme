# Nuclear Theme
## Requires PHP 5.4 or greater

This is my opinionated Wordpress boilerplate that I personally use on all my production websites.  There are some things that I will be changing/adding as I see fit.

## Features:
* Normalize.css
* SCSS Support/Directory structure
* Javascript minification/concatonation/linting
* Image optimization
* Gulp Task runner
* Bower asset management
* Utilities Classes
* Better Javascript Structure
* Nuclear 'micro' Api -> a simple way to run WP_Queries from the front end

## Major code snippets/inspiration borrowed from a lot of great starter themes including but not limited to
* Starkers (https://github.com/viewportindustries/starkers)
* Bones (https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones)
* Roots (https://github.com/roots/roots)
