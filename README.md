# Nuclear Theme
A Wordpress boilerplate that combines features from other boilerplates that I've found useful.  Additionally adds structure that I've found beneficial.

## Major code snippets/inspiration borrowed from a lot of great starter themes including but not limited to
* Starkers (https://github.com/viewportindustries/starkers)
* Bones (https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones)
* Roots (https://github.com/roots/roots)

## Requires PHP 5.4 or greater
